# Michael's Desktop Cookbook

Provisions any Ubuntu or Arch Linux system into the configuration that I use.
This servers as a replacement for people's collection of dot-files by using
chef to provision and manage the entire Linux desktop and configuration.

What is configured is a very heavily modified and opinionated (and beautiful)
configuration for i3.
